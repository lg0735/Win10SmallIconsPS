# Win10SmallIconsPS

This little powershell script will set your Windows 10 taskbar to small icons. That's it. You don't need admin privileges to do this. Just right click on the downloaded script, and hit Run in powershell. Done.
Note that this only works on Windows 10 (and possibly below), Windows 11 does not support small taskbar icons.

Some scenarios where this would be useful are:
1. Windows is not activated
2. The taskbar settings page is blocked by something (your organization?), and Registry editing is disabled
3. Why not?
